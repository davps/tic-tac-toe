https://github.com/davps/tic-tac-toe/commit/14351e298328162af2c4384eb2957d9beb66b6b2

- I understand how to optimize the rendering. 
I applied kwnoledge of the async nature of React's `setState` to render only once by removing the asynchronous updates and applying the Law of Demeter where required.
